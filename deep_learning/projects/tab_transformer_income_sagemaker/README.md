## Census Income Classification

This project tackles a binary classification problem with structured or tabular data. The goal is to predict whether an individual is likely to have an income exceeding USD 50,000 a year. We employ the [TabTransformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.06678) architecture, a state-of-the-art modeling structure designed for both supervised and semi-supervised learning, especially tailored for structured data. TabTransformer harnesses the power of Transformer layers, which are rooted in self-attention mechanisms. These layers refine the embeddings of categorical variables, yielding rich, context-aware embeddings.
