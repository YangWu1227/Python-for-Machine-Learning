## Census Income Classification

This project tackles a binary classification (structured or tabular data) problem; the task is to predict whether a person is likely to be making over USD 50,000 a year. We use the [TabTransformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.06678) architecture, which is an advanced modeling structure designed for both supervised and semi-supervised learning, especially for structured data. It leverages the power of Transformer layers, which are grounded in self-attention mechanisms. These layers enhance the embeddings of categorical variables, producing context-rich embeddings.
