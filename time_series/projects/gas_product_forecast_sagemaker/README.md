## Forecasting Australian Visitors

This project demonstrates an end-to-end workflow for time series forecasting using AWS SageMaker. We will be forecasting the monthly Australian short-term overseas visitors using historical data from May 1985 to April 2005. The entire project is built using various AWS services and Python, including AWS ECR, AWS SageMaker, AWS Lambda, and AWS API Gateway.
